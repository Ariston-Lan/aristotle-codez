# What Are Common Ways to Optomize Media Assets?
## Image Size
- When building a webstie you'll often display images in a specific size such as 640x480 resolution (where 640 is width and 480 is height).
- When preparing your image you want to scale it to a 640x480 size to match that styling. If you serve an image 1920x1080, but you are styling it to be much smaller, you're requiring your users to download unnecessary data.

## File Format
- Use the most up to date file formats (WEBP or AVIF). PNG and JPG also work but they are also outdated

## Compression Algorithms
- You can run compression algorithms on your images to reduce file size using tools such as pngcrush for PNGs.
- Not all formates are lossless. JPG uses lossy compression, each time a jpg is resaved or recompressed some image data is permanently discared, resulting in degraded quality.

# What Are the Different Types of Image Licenses, and How Do They Work?

- Not all images are free for you to use on your website. Beware, and look through image licenses.
- You usually must do one of three things: Obtain written permission from the copyright holder, purchase a license from the copyright h9older, or incorporate the image in a way that falls under fair use.

# What are SVGs, and When Should You Use Them?

## How Images Work
- Common image formats like PNG and JPG are classified as raster formats (meaning they are pixel based), with the data tracking the color value in each pixel

- Raster based images do not upscale well (trying to enlarge PNG and JPG makes them more blurry)

- SVG is a different kind of image that attempts to solve this issue

## SVG

- SVG stands for scalabe vector graphic. It essentially creates the image using plot points and equations, meaning it can be scaled without becoming pixelated or blurry

- SVG stores data in XML, meaning you can use them directly in your code as raw HTML using the svg element. This also means you can programmatically change the color of the image.

## SVG element

- The svg element is the container for the entire drawing. It sets up the space where all the shapes appear.

### Example:
```html
<!-- Star Icon !-->
<svg width="50" height="50" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="gold" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M12 2L14.9 8.6L22 9.3L17 14.1L18.3 21.2L12 17.8L5.7 21.2L7 14.1L2 9.3L9.1 8.6L12 2Z"/>
</svg>
```

# What Are the Roles of the HTML Audio and Video Elements, and How Do They Work?
## Audio element
- allows you to add sound content to your html documents.
- Supports popular formats such as mp3, wav, and ogg
## Video element
- allows you to add video content to your html
- supports popular formats such as mp4, ogg, and webm formats
## Inclusion of Audio Element
- To include audio element, type element with the src attribute to indicate the location of your audio file
- If you want to see the audio player on the page, include the CONTROLS attribute
### Example: Audio Element Attributes
```html
<audio src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/cruising-for-a-musing.mp3"
controls
loop
muted
></audio>
```
#### Controls attribute
- Controls is a boolean attribute that allows uers to manage audio playback (pausing/resuming)
- Some browsers, such as safari, may not display a volume control by default even when the control attribute is present
#### Loop attribute
- Loop is a boolean attribute that causes the audio to loop
#### Muted attribute
- Muted is a boolean attribute that causes the audio to be initially muted before playing

### Example: Audio File Types
```html
<audio control>
    <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>
```
- The browser will first start with the ogg type, and if it can't play the audio, it'll move down to the next type in the list

## Inclusion of Video Element
- All attributes for the audio element so far also apply to the video element.

### Example: Video Element Attributes
```html
<video
    src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
    loop
    controls
    muted
    width="400"
    poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
></video>
```
#### Source Attribute, Video File Types
- The same logic used for audio file types applies to video file types as well
```html
<video
  controls
  width="400"
  poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
>
  <source
    src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <source
    src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.webm"
    type="video/webm"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

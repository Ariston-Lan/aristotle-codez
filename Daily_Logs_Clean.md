# Day 1

Began building a Python task manager, built foundational struture (add task, remove task, view tasks)


---


# Day 2

Continued strengthening function usage, practiced calling functions and passing arguments.


---


# Day 3

Added and removed tasks from lists, practiced conditionals and input validation


---


# Day 4

Imrpoved program flow and organization, added better interaction system between functions


---


# Day 5

Focused on debugging and fixing logical errors, improved confidence reading error messages


---


# Day 6

Added a completed-task functionality:

```python
complete_task()
view_completed_tasks()
```
implemented transferring tasks betweena ctive and completed task lists.

---


# Day 7

Refactored (I've been WAITING to use that word) task structure from simple strings into dictionaries.

```python
Tasks are now stored as:
{'task name':difficulty}
```

---


# Day 8

Added task search functionality:

```python
search()
```
implemented substring matching for task names, added logic to detect when no matching tasks exist(I use this a LOT)

---


# Day 9

Added task filtering by difficulty, improved valdiation system (less errors!!), learned nested loops

```python
filter_tasks()
```

---


# Day 10

Refactored task dictionaries so now the dictionary actually store information seperately and effectively

```python
{
"name": task,
"difficulty": difficulty
}
```
This allows editing for tasks difficulty and structure

---


# Day 11

Added task priority system & an important task sorting function that sorts via lambda function:

```python
{
"name": task,
"difficulty": difficulty,
"priority": priority
}
sort_tasks()
tasks.sort(key=lambda item: item['priority'], reverse=True) #Since all tasks are in a list, this sorts the dictionaries based on greatest to least priority value
```

---


# Day 12

Added due date system using weekdays, exapnded task structure AGAIN:

```python
{
"name": task,
"difficulty": difficulty,
"priority": priority,
"due_date": due_date
}
```
Also added function that filters due dates
```python
show_due_soon()
```

---


# Day 13

Added an advanced filter that includes both difficulty and priority:

```python
advanced_filter(tasks)
```
Did more nested loops practice as well

---


# Day 14

I have officially reached a point in my project where adding more functions creates a more convoluted function than efficient one

which is why I am now working on efficiency in my system (in a very laidback way because this project is more of a sandbox to me right now than anything else).
With that being said, I made an auto_assign_priority feature that's based on the tasks difficulty:
```python
auto_assign_priority(difficulty)
```
Also did more nested loops drills

---


# Day 15

Added a command to view statistics regarding your stats, and did a simple nested loop drill looking at what was the most frequent number within

a list. Also, made my verification process more concise for verifying user inputting an incorrect due_date (Now all due_dates must be in valid_days[], instead of
a long list of does due_date == monday or due_date == tuesday, and so on). Tomorrow, going to rework my menu so it feels more smooth.
```python
task_statistics(tasks, completed_tasks):
valid_days = ['monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday','sunday']
```

---


# Day 16

I am so tired and my brain is fried. Anyways, again my main thing here is making the program readable and less repetitive and convoluted. I created

a function for displaying tasks since I would always type the same tasks into a string format over and over, so now that's display_task(item, index=False).
Also, did a drill where you had to find the second most frequent number. Really honed in on keeping a memory bank of duplicate values, comparing them, and a 
'multi-variable leaderboard system'. Its annoying but it was helpful ish. So in short, refractor(again), and annoying drill.

---


# Day 17

Did an easy drill using nested loop and tracking amount. Added a new category variable to each new task and a way to filter tasks by category.

Also redid the menu to make it smaller and less convoluted. Tasks now look like:
```python
({
"name":task,
"difficulty":difficulty,
"priority":priority,
"due_date":date,
"category":category
})
```

---


# Day 18

So apparently I forgot to actually log day 18 ON day 18, so I am sort of writing this with hazy memory. But from what I remember,

since yesteday I updated tasks (and across the days have been updating tasks with new features) I improved the editting task feature so that
a user can edit all types of attributes a task has. I also refined the UI and menu, and the filtering tasks
```python
def display_task(item, index=False, include_category=False):
```
Also did a pretty easy drill on tracking duplicate numbers within a list and returning all of them.

---


# Day 19

Today felt a little unproductive, I made a function to create inputs for me since I was tired of validating every single integer input.

```python
def create_input(integer=False,text=False):
```
Basically it allows you to validate and create an input thats either a number or text. By doing that I also had to make a way for the inner function,
which is the create_input, to send a message to the outer function, for example it could be remove_task, in order to stop the outer function when the
input is invalid. This was pretty simple, just gotta make the inner function return a signal that the outer function checks to stop. Feels like
a clunky solution but it works. I also simplified a lot of unecessary validations I was doing, and did a very easy drill on looping through dictionaries.

---


# Day 20

I did a lot of validation refractoring (dont know if I am using that correctly) but basically I added some more validations. Now there is a validation

```python
for categories, priorities, and I will probably add one for difficulties as well later too. I also went through and actually added my previous create_input() function
```
to nearly everything, and I am thinking about adding an extra part of the function to check if the input is empty for future functions. For now I won't add it though since
most of my functions don't do that. I also did a drill on sorting incomplete tasks based on priority from greatest to least.
It was easy since I just used a reverse sort function + a loop to check which tasks were incomplete. 
```python
def validate_category(category):
if not category in valid_categories:
print(f'{category} must be one of the following:\n{valid_categories}')
return
return category
def validate_priority(priority):
if priority < 1 or priority > 5:
print('Prioity must be a number 1-5')
return
return priority
def validate_date(date):
if not date in valid_days:
print(f'{date} is not a day Monday-Sunday')
return
return date
```

---


# Day 21

I didn't do a lot programming wise today, because instead I dedicated the majority of the session to learning JSON, and finish a drill about sorting through

tasks and getting categories from tasks. Which was pretty easy, it was like sorting through numbers except I had to use the structure for tasks instead.
But the most impotant thing is I learned how to use JSON files, and how to save and load dictionaries. This will help make my project feel a lot more real,
as its no longer just adding cool features but real retention of information across runthroughs.
```python
import json
```

tasks = []

```python
tasks.append({'name':'Homework'})
tasks.append({'name':'Gym'})
tasks.append({'name':'Python'})
```

```python
with open('mydata.json', 'w') as f:
json.dump(tasks, f)
print('ran')
print(tasks)
tasks.clear()
if not tasks:
print('No current tasks, loading from save file')
f = open('mydata.json')
tasks = json.load(f)
f.close
print(tasks)
```

This is me testing out JSON and how it works.

---


# Day 22

I am so tired, but today was relatively easy, added file persistence to my program through JSON and os. I truly don't know too much about these things,

I know JSON is for managing files within python and I assume os is like a simple way to access and look at files. I used os to check whether user_date was empty then
obviously I used JSON to save and load data, so now file data persists between users. The next step after I spruce up the menu and add some key features, is making this program able
to handle multiple users. After that I might ship it, just so I can see that process, not expecting a real successful app to come out of this but experimenting with UI for this app 
could really work out well for me I think.
```python
def save_data(data, tasks, completed_tasks, name):
```
---
```python
def run():
should_quit = False
data = 'user_data.json'
if not os.path.isfile(data):
print('What is your name?')
name = get_name()
while not name:
name = get_name()
print(f'Hello {name}!')
tasks = []
completed_tasks = []
data = save_data(data, tasks, completed_tasks, name)
else:
f = open('user_data.json')
data = json.load(f)
f.close
tasks = data['tasks']
completed_tasks = data['completed_tasks']
name = data['username']
print(f'Hey {name}!')
```

This is all the major code I did today. Super excited because this step makes my program feel real, and also makes me feel like I can do so much more with future projects!!!

---


# Day 23

This day was ass. I learned that copy is INCREDIBLY important when creating an undo functionality. My method was not the most efficient but I did it purely so I can learn

and not use the same long strenious method ever again. That is it, that is the whole log for today because I truly am that irritated.
```python
def backlog(tasks, completed_tasks, name):
tasks_backlog = []
for task in tasks:
tasks_backlog.append(task.copy())
backlog = {'tasks':(tasks_backlog),
'completed_tasks':completed_tasks.copy(),
'username':name
}
return backlog
```

This is what I did and I ALSO made every single function take a screenshot (the backlog) at the start and RETURN the screenshot if the function completed successfully. Then I made backlog
that specific screenshot ONLY IF the function had returned a truthy value (which in this case the only truthy value it returns IS the screenshot so yea).

---


# Day 24

Okay so at the time of writing this I am actually on day 29, I haven't been uploading daily because I was busy doing so much stuff for graduation! Hanging out with family going to parties etc.

So these logs will be less thorough and more of a brief overview of what I believe I did on each day.
Today I spent a long time with the 'undo' system in the task manager, specifically making it use state management to get undos instead of what I was doing before.
```python
elif choice == 'undo':
if undo_history:
undo_state = undo_history.pop()
tasks = undo_state['tasks']
completed_tasks = undo_state['completed_tasks']
name = undo_state['username']
auto_save = undo_state['autosave']
current_state = {
'tasks':tasks,
'completed_tasks':completed_tasks,
'name':name,
'autosave':auto_save
}
```

---

```python
def backlog(current_state):
```

---

So as you can see above, undo now relies on a current_state, and the current_state is updated as the program mutates. Backlog is essentially a screenshot of the current state, and it activates
at the start of every function that mutates the user's tasks list (clear, remove, edit, add, etc.). Then if the function continues normally (no input errors), it'll return the screenshotted state BEFORE the mutation.
After this occurs, in the run() function, variable memory is assigned the screenshot of the state before mutation. and then this memory variable is appended to the undo history. Also learned that ASSIGNING lists and MUTATING them affects current_state.

---


# Day 25

I prototyped LOCKIN, made it funcitonal, logical, but it felt veryyy unfulfilling due to how quickly and easy I made it, which is why today all I did was plan out my learning path.

I have decided learning HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT is probably for the best so I can start shipping real things, and also continuing python so that I can keep learning both coding and engineering skills.

---


# Day 26

Started learning basic HTML through codecamp. I won't go through everything I learned, but I know the basic syntax rules, how to make images, texts, headings, titles, href, etc.


---


# Day 27

I made both a validation system for dates (for LOCKIN), and yes I realize there is a database that does that but I wasn't aware while I was making it soooo too late. Also made a timer, a working one but only within the terminal.

I should probably explain what LOCKIN is though. LOCKIN is an app idea that I had in which a user initiates a lockin session, a giant timer is on their phone now (on the app), and they can choose 15 minutes to an hour (in the prototype). The goal is
to sort of "lock" their phone, but not literally, more like the user intentionally enters a study session and so they go on the lockin app so there is friction to go on their phone. Then after the session is over, the user rates the session, and the goal is
after enough time you'll have an accumulation of all the different LOCKIN sessions you've had, you can look at your reflections and what you did during them. Anyways right now, its simply a timer and a session storage system.

---

```python
import time
def stop_watch():
start_time = time.time()
try:
while True:
current_time = time.time()
seconds = int((current_time-start_time)%60)
minutes = (int((current_time-start_time)/60))%60
hours = (int((current_time-start_time)/3600))%60
print(f'{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}')
time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
end_time = time.time()
final_time = int(end_time - start_time)
return final_time
overtime = stop_watch()
print(overtime)
```

---


# Day 28

I made both a stopwatch and countdown timer (actually implemented within LOCKIN this time). Really don't got too much to say other than that, implemented them into LOCKIN and tried my best to

seperate the differnet roles of the functions so that the code is readable and you can follow it. Could've done a better job at the abstracting part but I think I did alright.
```python
def create_session(sessions):
chosen_duration = choose_duration()
timer_time = chosen_duration*60
user_ended_duration = timer(timer_time)
if user_ended_duration:
duration = user_ended_duration
else:
duration = chosen_duration
overtime = overtime_stopwatch()
if type(overtime) == str:
final_duration = duration
elif type(overtime) == int:
final_duration = duration + overtime
print('LOCKIN SESH DONE!!!')
valid_ratings = ['red','yellow','green']
print("Date:\n")
date = create_date()
if not date:
return
print('Rate LOCKIN session')
rating = create_input(text=True)
if not rating in valid_ratings:
print('Rating must be red, yellow, or green')
return
displayed_time = display_time(final_duration)
print(displayed_time)
session = {
'date':date,
'rating':rating,
'duration':displayed_time
}
sessions.append(session)
return session
```

---


# Day 29

Today was pretty straightfoward. I continued to learn HTML (which I am not posting here simply because it was through codecamp/not my own structured project yet)

and I also did a "python diagnostic" which is where I chose from a randomly assigned task and coded it in under an hour. It took my 21 minutes to make a simple student gradebook,
which I am sure any programmer could do but for me it represented the milestone in which my fundamentals for building and creating had been somehwat solidifed enough to create my own things,
which I think is pretty neat. Oh also I learned classes as well, so I recreated the student gradebook but instead of using functions and dictionaries I used classes as a more concise way to structure
the system.

---


# Day 30

Today was tiring. Yesterday I just briefly was introduced to classes. Today I created an entire program in which classes interacted with one another, different objects and all of that.

Conceptually it was easy, actually making everything work especially with the run() function and keep track of a system that large taught me something: ABSTRACTING IS NOT JUST FOR FUN. Its not just clever
it is literally the only thing stopping my brain from exploding as I handle 15 different versions of the same request. With that being said, lots of potential errors in the program but also? Given the fact
that I had learned classes a day ago, I consider the project a success. I will lightly polish it tomorrow and then probably never touch it again however because...it really annoyed me. Great for learning tho!
```python
class User:
class Habit:
class Habitat:
def view_habitats(glob_habitats)
def add_habitat(glob_habitats):
def remove_habitat(glob_habitats, user):
def run():
coding = Habitat('Coding', 'Coding everydayyy fooo')
run()
```

Yes I omitted the code on purpose because it was too fat to fit here. But important takeaways, I was able to create my prototype by thinking of an idea, and bringing it into reality using a new concept.
That is useful. I was also able to visualize and build interacting objects through class interaction. I made a system that is more expandable and personal than the previous one utilizing only dictionaries and functions.

---


# Day 31

I felt super drained today for a variety of reasons so all I did was add a simple user validation system to the HabitHabitat program and called it a day.

```python
def validate_animal(animal):
def get_animal():
def validate_username(username):
def get_username():
def get_display_name():
def validate_display_name(display_name):
```

---


# Day 32

So today I added to the habit habitat program even though I said I would abandon the project. All I did was add the feature of saving user data and loading it, which ended up taking me

2 hours because I was unaware of SERILIZATION (not sure if I spelled that correctly.) So today I learned how to do that. Which is essentially just unpacking data from a class object since python can't
read class objects after loading or saving which...makes since because when you try to load that class object suddenly does not exist. So I packed all the data into a dictionary when quitting the program
and then unpacked it back into classes, and back into lists, when the program gets booted up. Pretty cool stuff if I say so myself.
```python
def unpack_habitat_data(habitat_data):
def unpack_habit_data(habit_data)
def get_user_data(user):
def save_user_data(data):
def load_user_data():
def save_glob_data(glob_habitats):
def load_glob_data():
```


---


# Day 33

36 - The reason that, for the first time in this daily log I am combining days together, is because across these days I have been slowly chipping away at the freeCodeCamp course on html, and haven't

actually built any website or project yet. I don't really have anything to show, other than the linkage to my notes which are just simple markdown notes on what freeCodeCamp is teaching me. I am almost done with the
course as of today (day 36), however, I think it would be better if I also made an ongoing html project similar to how I have done python projects. So that I can have, and see, a measureable output of growth on my 
frontend development journey.

---


# Day 37

Today I just took notes and finished my final subject for basic HTML. I learned a bit about relative and absolute paths, specifically the importance of single dot, double dot, and slashes when dicating file

paths. I also learned the different link states, what they mean, and how to represent them in code.


# Day 37 pt 2

Okay so technically this is supposed to be day 38, but I am also posting my sessions on instagram and I didnt post the html notes, instead I posted what I did today (day 38) as day 37 on instagram. So for

the sake of organization, this is a continuation of day 37. I havent coded for nearly 2 weeks, for a plethora of reasons (I got into a car crash and my hands got mangled + college) So I wanted to re-enter OOP with a simple project,
a banking system. I actually didn't even get the bank thing to work because of a variety of reasons but the important part is I got some rust off of my coding skills.

---



# Day 38

39 - For both of these days I have been taking notes on HTML, but also I have started to apply the HTML I've been learning into a sort of handbook of all the features I've learned.

Right now this only exists for day 39 because I only started it for day 39. But I will be making a literal html handbook, which is just a giant page in html, of everything that I have learned so far.
So today was: learning html and writing it in markdown notes, and creating a html only webpage using those exact skills I took notes on. After this I will work on a simple class project for python and then
I'll finish up for the day.

---


# Day 40

Did a lot of HTML notes on the semantic use of abbreviations, address, U, S, ruby, code, and a LOT of other elements. I have started making a HTML project page for each day where I apply the concepts I learn for each day.

Other than that, did not do too much.

---


# Day 41

I started a giant project known as the HTML Pantheon. Okay Giant is an understatement, but essentially it is going to evolve into my first ever webpage.

Each page includes an important element that codecamp forced me to learn. I recognize there are probably LOADS of elements missing from it, but I chose the most important ones,
or rather the fundamental ones that I learned from codecamp. I think it can be an ongoing project that I add to as I learn more HTML, but for now it is meant to function
as a sort of synthesis for everything I have learned. Since each page discusses an important element, I will have effectively applied every single thing that I have learned onto an 
actual webpage which I think is sort of cool.

---


# Day 42

I learned how to create forms, and created a simple application of what I'd learn into a project page

```python
with a prototype of a potential survey for habithabitat
```

---


# Day 43

I built a simple banking terminal project (one that actually works this time) using getters and setters. I just made it to understand them

better than I could before.  I didn't do any html today cause I was so tired. I learned some pretty surface level fundamentals on encapsulation, and why
people use getters and setters in the first place, but other than that pretty uneventful coding session.

---


# Day 44

I took some more notes on HTML, specifically learned how to create tables through html and started learning the importance of having accessible websites.

I know that for the last few days I have been just saying I am "doing notes on HTML", but I have real projects that I have been working on too. Specifically project pages
detailing the elements that I had learned that specific day. Today I added some stuff to my HTML Pantheon as well, and learned some accessibility tools that I'll have to test out
personally. I hope that I can find a good space to have disabled people of various types test my webpages, because I don't wanna neglect that skill  just because I can't drill it as
readily as I can with anything else.

---


# Day 45

Took even MORE notes on HTML, and specifically I am learning about accessibility, ARIA and a bunch of other abbreviations I forgot the name of. Basically, it is important that webpages

are accessible to those with disabilities. Things like screenreaders, and various other non keyboard and mouse set-ups require websites that can remain accessible to those things. So that's what I
am learning/taking notes on. I also did my first API. "did my first API" sounds weird but I phrase it like that because I had to look up a tutorial and I didn't formally learn how to integrate EVERY API,
but I learned the general basis of API sends HTTP request to the server, server gives back raw info, and in my case turns that info into python data that I can use any way I like. Later I'll use this to build
a simple clothes shopping app that shows the lowest prices item based on a vague search.

---


# Day 46

Took my final notes on HTML (hopefully) since I finished the codecamp HTML course! Now I just have to get through CSS and then boom. Learned the finishing things about aria attributes

and then went on to make some codecamp based labs and workshops on them. Didnt do a project page this time though

---


# Day 47

Learned about inheritance and polymorphism and so I build HabitHabitat, again, using a LOT of different classes. The entire thing that this project was supposed to teach me was that,

different classes can inherit different traits and you just divide responsibilities accordingly, for one, and also so you dont have to retype a bunch of code. I did this using in total, 8 classes.
Which is not that much but it took me a couple hours. Not because I was failing at inheritance, but because I was trying to make every single system work as a system.
The HabitHabitatSystem class called methods from each of the other classes, it managed the entire thing. It was able to store multiple users and within those user objects, store their habits, habitats,
and those habits stored their own information, basically just a lot of information being moved and updated and mutated. And lots of validation due to that. Very much enjoyed this project though! 
I even used some encapsualtion as well.

---

```python
class Habit:
class Habitat:
class User:
class Animal(Habit):
class Owl(Animal):
class Wolf(Animal):
class Foxclass HabitHabitatSystem:
```

system = HabitHabitatSystem()
```python
system.run()
```
-----------
Then obviously there is a LOT more code within those things (Actually only 295 lines roughly).

---
# Day 48

Did not too much work today, I took notes on foundational parts of a computer (as per the codecamp course), and then I also did a codecamp workshop on inheritance in order to make a media catalogue.
```python
class Movie:
    def __init__(self, title, year, director, duration):
        if not title.strip():
            raise ValueError('Title cannot be empty')
        if year < 1895:
            raise ValueError('Year must be 1895 or later')
        if not director.strip():
            raise ValueError('Director cannot be empty')
        if duration <= 0:
            raise ValueError('Duration must be positive')
        self.title = title
        self.year = year
        self.director = director
        self.duration = duration

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.title} ({self.year}) - {self.duration} min, {self.director}'

class MediaCatalogue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add(self, media_item):
        self.items.append(media_item)
    def __str__(self):
        if not self.items:
            return 'Media Catalogue (empty)'
        result = f'Media Catalogue ({len(self.items)} items):\n\n'
        for index, movie in enumerate(self.items):
            result += f'{index}. {str(movie)}\n'
        return result
try:
    movie1 = Movie('The Matrix', 1999, 'The Wachowskis', 136)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f'Validation Error: {e}')

Med = MediaCatalogue()
Med.add(movie1)
print(Med)
```
I also did some CSS and learned the basic anatomy of it.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">

        <meta charset="UTF-8">

                <h2>Basic CSS</h2>
                <p>First let's start with the basic anatomy behind CSS. CSS has selectors, and within selectors there are declarations. Within those declarations, there are properties, and each property has a corresponding value. The selectors are made to select the HTML element that will be stylized, while the declaration is the container for the actual style declaration. Within the declaration, there is a specific property you are aiming to alter, and that property has a value that you can change about it.</p>

                <p style="color: purple;">Inline CSS is used within the style attribute on an HTMl element to stylize
                    that specific element. For example I used inline CSS to make this purple

                <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
                <p>Internal CSS on the other hand, is used to stylize an entire page of elements. However, the
                    stylization is limited to one page. Which is why internal CSS is usually only used on singular page projects.
                    For example, I used internal CSS to make it to where every single paragraph element on this page has a font size
                    of 18 pixels.

                <h2>External CSS</h2>
                <p>External CSS is when an external CSS file is linked to an HTML file, in which that file (often referred to as a stylesheet)
                    contains all the relevant styles for that webpage. This is the most commonly used form of CSS as it allows for multiple pages
                    to be styles at once.

# Day 49

Today I did some CSS, learned how to style pages, use IDs and classes more effectively than I had been before. I also did another codecamp workshop, this one was about abstraction where I learned about abstraction methods/overriding certain methods. Even sometimes creating an entire base class where the methods are meant to be overridden (which seems like overkill now but I am sure the usage will become clear later.)

            <h1>Project Page day 49: Width and Height, CSS Comibinators, Block-level elements, Inline elements, inline-block elements, Margins, & Padding</h1>
            <p>
                It looks like I learned a lot but a lot of this stuff is overlapping (or rather compounding knowledge rather than an entirely new topic.)
                For one, the width and height are self explanatory, they allow you to alter the width and height of the content box that naturally surrounds
                HTML elements. I bet you're wondering then, <em>what exactly is the content box?</em> Well, that's defined through block-level elements, inline-elements,
                 and inline-block elements. Then margin and padding work based on those things too! Margin adds spacing outside of the content box, while padding adds space in it.
                 The CSS combinators on the other hand are just ways to reference html elements in CSS based on relative info, like siblings and parents for instance.

                <h2 class="title">Content Box</h2>
                <p class="description">Since I keep referencing this word, I will just give a quick section demonstrating it.
                    The content box is the borders surrounding an element, and there are two types. The block-level
                    elements and the inline-elements. The block-level elements take up an entire line of space, no matter
                    the inner content.

                <p class="description">As you can see, the difference between an inline element and a block-level element,
                     is that the block level element's border extends to the entire page (creating a new line), whereas the
                    inline element only takes the space it needs.

                 <h3 class="title">Height, Width, and inline-block elements</h3>
                 <p class="description">Height and width alter the width and height of the context box.
                     However, inline elements cannot have their content box altered by this way.

                         its height and width are able to be altered.

                <p class="description">Margin and padding are simple. Margin increases the space outside of your context box,
                     while padding increases the space inside your content box.

# Day 50
Today, I didn't actually do that much. I took notes on CSS, and I thne did a codecamp workshop for python and went to flask afterwards. However, I failed to set up flask because I messed up the file structure, and I just got SO frustrated I quit for the day. In CSS I learned specificity, things like that, and in python I was learning about abstraction and the abstraction base class, and also how to build a polygon calculator and other codecamp labs/workshops that are for maintaining my OOP, and brushing on abstraction/abstraction classes, concrete classes and abstraction methods/concrete methods.

As for the flask part, I did make some progress, but overall I think itd be better to just start fresh with it tomorrow.

# Day 51
Okay so I did CSS, did an entire project page, took notes on Python data structures (stacks, queues, Big O notation, time complexity and storage complexity) AND I set up my flask...set up? I am not sure what to call it, but the web interface I set up using flask. I learned what packages and modules are formally, and what flask is doing, why I should use virtual environments, and things like that. I sent my first real HTTP request and received it too. It's a little fuzzy since I am writing this after about 7 hours of work (cumulative across all 3 activites), but a lot of progress was made.
